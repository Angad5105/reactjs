<h1>What is React?</h1>
<p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012. It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013.</p>
<p>In computing, React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.</p>


<h1>How react is useful?</h1>
<p>React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. Complex React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, routing, and interaction with an API</p>

<p>Properties are passed to a component from the parent component. Components receive props as a single set of immutable values(a JavaScript object). At the heart of all React applications are components. A component is a selfcontained module that renders some output. We can ırite interface
elements like a button or an input field as a React component. Components
are composable. A component might include one or more other components
in its output.</p>
<img src="react3.png" class="img-rounded cen" alt="">
<p>React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. Importantly, each component in a React app abides y strict data
management principles. </p>


<h1>Prototype</h1>

<p>We are working on a project called Pharmacy Management System, in which our motive is to provide a simple interface of pharmacy management system to the pharmacy owners in some specific countries in Asia. It will be usefull in maintaining the pharmacy records like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales</li>
<li>Manufacturing Date</li>
<li>Expiry Date</li>
<li>Brands</li>
<li>Companies</li>
</ul>

<p>It will also help in predicting and keeping records of the heath problems and trending medicies available and what do people usually buy.</p>
